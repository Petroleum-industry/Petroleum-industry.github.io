# Introduction to well logging
Logging can be in two types either in Wireline or LWD, now the question is : what is wireline? what is LWD?

Wireline operation happens after you drill the well and you pull the bottom hole assembly, once you pull BHA the only thing that exist in the wellbore is the drilling fluid (Mud).

Principe: Wire woming out of the truck, this wire contain some conductors (normally 7 conductors) that sends and receives information from the tools, we aquire data and we communicate with the tools from the surface to the bottom hole.

the other type called LWD: Logging While Drilling, you acctually do the logging while you are driiling, this means that your tools are not on wire, your tools is part of the BHA.

Principe:We'll gonna hang the BHA, the tools will be connected to the BHA and puting the tool inside the wellbore as part of the BHA:you are not waiting or finishing the drilling you need to evaluate your recervoir while you are drilling .
